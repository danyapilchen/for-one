            <p>This piece is an attempt to imagine a fundamentally lonely musical experience. For example, a solo performance usually involves two minds: one of a player and one of a listener. Even when one plays in a room alone, one is both: one plays, another listens to oneself. Consequently, a fundamentally lonely performer does not listen to themself. Such a lonely performance is possible while inattentively humming a tune on a walk, but the moment one notices it, it is not lonely anymore.
            <br><br>In this piece, I am depriving a performer—in this case, myself—of an ability to listen to, or even imagine, any result of their actions. All I can do is to click on a button. Then, one of the listeners may receive a sound, but I don’t know when and which sound they might hear, nor if they hear anything at all. The same goes for listeners: they see when I send a message, but none of them might know who and when will receive it.</p>
